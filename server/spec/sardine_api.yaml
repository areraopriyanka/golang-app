      summary: Evaluate customer session/transaction Risk
      description: |-
        Refer to the [overview](/guides/integration/developerResources/authentication#api-authentication) for API URL and Authentication. Check all the *reason codes* returned in signals [here](/guides/integration/developerResources/reasonCodes#reason-codes). Use the top level field called as level in the response to make your risk decisioning and use other response fields to understand the reasons for the risk level.

        <h3>Products</h3>

        | Use Case | Description |How| Checkpoint(s) |
        |--------|---------|------------|---------|
        |KYC|SSN Verification with Synthetic ID detection | Pass taxId in the request. If you want to do KYC SSN verification, customers id, taxid, name, dob and address are required. Please refer to the KYC (SSN Verification) example on RHS.| `customer` |
        |KYC|Sanctions Screening & Monitoring (PEP, Sanction, AdverseMedia) | Pass Name and Country (DOB is optional but reduces false positives) after this is enabled by Sardine. As seen in the example you can pass Place of birth using personalInfo Onboarding. Please refer to the KYC (Sanctions) example on RHS.| `customer` |
        |Payment Fraud|Card Fraud|Pass transaction.paymentMethod.type = "card" for transaction.amount > 0. Please refer to the Payment Fraud (Card) example on RHS.| `customer` + `payment` |
        |Payment Fraud|Bank Fraud| Pass transaction.paymentMethod.type = "bank" for transaction.amount > 0. Please refer to the Payment Fraud (Bank) example on RHS.| `customer` + `ach` |
        |Anti-Money Laundering/Transaction Monitoring| AML Foundational - Fiat and Crypto (BYO data)|For crypto Transaction Monitoring (TM), pass: crypto address in the address field. For Fiat TM, pass: transaction object. Please refer to the AML (Fiat & Crypto) example on RHS.| `aml` |
        |Anti-Money Laundering/Transaction Monitoring|AML Crypto with Analytics| For crypto address analytics, the "Crypto Analytics" flag must be enabled by Sardine to enable blockchain monitoring. Please ensure to talk to your Integration Manager about enabling this. Please refer to the AML (Crypto) example on RHS.| `aml` |

        <h3>Typical Integration Issues</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Different sessionKey and/or userIdHash (customer.id) values are used across the Device SDK and Customer API; they need to be the same values, i.e.:
            <ul>
              <li>Front End Device SDK *sessionKey* must correspond to the Back End Customer API's *sessionKey* value</li>
              <li>Front End Device SDK *userIdHash* must correspond to the Back End Customer API's *customer.id* value</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li> Country/Region/Phone number is not passed in ISO format. e.g. phone number has +1 missing for US.</li>
          <li> Some data is not passed, despite it being available to the merchant to easily pass, e.g., Country or createdAtMillis or Address line 1 is missing.</li>
          <li> OrderNumber is not passed in the transaction.id field and instead sessionKey is passed.</li>
        </ol>

        *Important Customers API Checkpoints Behavior*
        <br/>
        Please refer to [checkpoints](/guides/integration/developerResources/checkpoints#checkpoints) for recommended use cases, descriptions and prerequisites.
        <ol>
          <li>When calling the customers API, if no checkpoint is specified, then the checkpoint defaults to "customer"</li>
          <li>When the "customer" checkpoint is invoked, the "device" checkpoint is also automatically applied, which determines the risk level of the device being used. The risk level determined by the devices checkpoint will only impact the device risk level (device.level) response field</li>
          <li>
            When calling the customers API, if a checkpoint is specified, then only that checkpoint will be executed
            <ul>
              <li>e.g., if "aml" is called, only "aml" would be called</li>
              <li>If the merchant wants "customer" to be run, then they would *need* to specify both "customer" and "aml"</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            When calling the customers API, regardless of what checkpoints are specified (i.e., regardless of the two items above), the "device" checkpoint is always called <b>if either:</b>
            <ul>
              <li>The sessionKey matches an existing sessionKey whose device data was sent to Sardine via SDK, *or*</li>
              <li>The device.id that is sent matches an existing Sardine device.id</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Important Customers API Notes</h3>
        <br/>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Calling the Customers API
            <ul>
              <li>When calling the customers API multiple times, you will need to pass all the customer-level information in the top-level customer object the first time (this is intuitive)</li>
              <li>For subsequent API calls for that same customer, you don't need to (but you can) re-pass data, e.g., customer.firstName, customer.lastName, etc. Only the customer.id will need to be passed. If you don't re-pass this data to us, Sardine will use the existing name, email, phone, address, and SSN that exist in our records from the most recent customers API request</li>
              <li>*NOTE* this does not apply to advanced fields like personalInfo and custom fields; for such fields, merchants need to always pass these fields if they want to use them in rules.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Passing customer-level info
            <ul>
              <li>Use the <b>top-level customer object</b> to send master customer data, e.g., firstName, lastName, etc.</li>
              <li>*Do NOT use customer.personalInfo* unless explicitly discussed with Sardine for your use-case</li>
              <li>customer.personalInfo is used only if you perform verification(s) via a non-Sardine third-party provider.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Retry mechanism
            <ul>
              <li>As a best practice, we'd recommend you implement a retry mechanism as detailed [here](/guides/integration/developerResources/ResponseandRetry#retry-mechanism)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>

        Please *review* the JSON data with Sardine during development, before deploying this API in production.
        There may be some *undocumented* fields in our API response. Please ignore them as they may be present for backward compatibility or may be in beta.

        This business API allows the merchants to verify new U.S businesses for compliance and sanction screening.

        This API allows merchants to create business entities within the Sardine platform. Merchants can then perform business verification, screening, and enrichment requests for those entities.

        The following request provides the required fields for basic Secretary of State verification for business entities in the United States and sanction screening. The `config` object is used to determine which enrichments should be run.

The U.S. Treasury Department said in a statement it blacklisted Aung Pyae Sone and Khin Thiri Thet Mon, the adult children of Myanmar's commander in chief . The six Myanmar companies blacklisted by Washington include A&M Mahar, which is controlled by Aung Pyae Sone, the general's son. Justice for Myanmar said A&M offers foreign pharmaceutical companies access to Myanmar's market by obtaining approvals from Myanmar's Food and Drug Administration.

        This API allows merchants to query created business entities within the Sardine platform for basic Secretary of State verification for business entities in the United States.

        Sardine recommends an <b>exponential backoff with 15 seconds</b> for polling of this endpoint after a new business entity has been submitted.

        Sardine will be updating this specification in the future to support a variety of verification, screening, and enrichment types, which may require us to introduce new fields.

      summary: Realtime risk check for credit/debit card authorization requests (for card issuers)
      description: |
        Please refer to [API Authentication](/guides/integration/developerResources/authentication) for API URL and authentication.

        This API endpoint can be used for real-time transaction approval decisions.

        Note you must call [/v1/customers API](/guides/api-reference/customer/evaluate-customer-sessiontransaction-risk) at least once prior to calling this API with customer information so Sardine can pre-compute customer-level risk information and can correlate the `cardId` (/v1/issuing/risks) to the `transaction.paymentMethod.card.hash` (/v1/customers) that is sent in this API request.

        Sardine automatically sets `issuingrisk` as the checkpoint for this API endpoint. You can review the rules applied under the `issuingrisk` checkpoint in [Sardine Dashboard](https://dashboard.sardine.ai/rules?checkpoint=issuingRisk).

      description: |-
        Please refer to [API Authentication](/guides/integration/developerResources/authentication) for API URL and authentication.

        This API returns list of users whose screening (sanction, PEP and adversed media) risk check result has been changed in the specified time period.

        Initial you can leave the cursor empty following that you need to add the cursor to your request to get next set of results. if the results are null or empty you have no more results.

        Given that Sardine performs a daily screening for OFAC Sanctions, PEP, and Adverse Media, we would recommend you use this API daily to stay up-to-date.

        This same functionality is also available without using the API and utilizing the SANCTION_UPDATE checkpoint. Please consult with your Integration Manager on how to set this rule up in the checkpoint so that daily screening and case creation automatically occurs within the Sardine dashboard.
