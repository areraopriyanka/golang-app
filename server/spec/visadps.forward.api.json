It accommodates the various card replacement scenarios (lost/stolen, or undelivered) as well as standard card reissuance needs. In card replacement, the cardId remains the same. The replacement card has the same card number as the current card except for these scenarios where a different card number is issued:<br><ul> <li>Replacements for lost/stolen cards</li> <li>Replacements for undeliverable cards </li></ul> The expiration date defaults to your configurations for card lifecycle unless explicitly specified in the request. If cardStockId, cardVendorId, collateralId, and shippingMethod fields are left blank, this API uses the configured default values you set during onboarding.<br><br>The stored shipping address in the profile is the default address where cards are shipped. Including a shipping address in the request overrides the default shipping address.<br><br>MLE: Mandatory",

Both positive and negative balance values are allowed.<br><br>If either one of the following conditions is true, the Balance Sync request is denied:<br><br> • Last balance date/timestamp, if provided, precedes the date/timestamp of the current Balance Sync request<br> • The consensusToken, if provided, does not match the account’s last financial consensus token on the DPS Forward system  <br><br>MLE: Optional",
