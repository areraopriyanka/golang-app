Here’s how: To stop a recurring ACH transfer to a merchant you preauthorized to debit your Checking Account, please contact the merchant to request cancellation of the recurring payment. If the merchant with whom you arranged recurring ACH transfers from your Checking Account is unable or unwilling to stop the transfer you have the right to request a stop on such payment. If you call, we may require you to put your request in writing and to provide us with a copy of your notice to the payee, revoking the payee’s authority to originate debits to your account, within 14 days after you call. If we do not receive the written confirmation within 14 days, we may honor subsequent debits to your account. Your request to stop payment must be received at least three (3) business days before the payment is scheduled to be made. If you fail to give us your request at least three business days prior to a transfer, we may attempt at our sole discretion, to stop the payment. We assume no responsibility for our failure or refusal to do so, however, even if we accept the request for processing. Such a stop payment request will cancel a single, i.e. one (1) recurring payment. If you want to permanently stop all recurring payments to a specific merchant, you will be required to put your request in writing within fourteen (14) days after your notification to stop such payments. You will need to tell us the name of the payee, the dollar amount of the payment and the date of the payment. If written stop payment notification is not received within fourteen (14) days, the payment in question will be honored as originally authorized and future payments will not be permanently stopped. Under certain circumstances the stop payment may not be effective. In the event the stop payment is ineffective, please contact us to submit a dispute and review your options, such as completing the Written Statement of Unauthorized Debit or any other forms, closing your account or issuing a new card."
